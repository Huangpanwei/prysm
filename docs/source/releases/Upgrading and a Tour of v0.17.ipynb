    "# Upgrading and a Tour of v0.17\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a tour of prysm v0.17 and demonstrates the new features and updates made in this release.  It also serves as a guide to upgrading your code from v0.16 to v0.17.  In general, if you use prysm as an embedded modeling or analysis tool you probably need to make few to no changes and your code will still run and produce the same outputs.  One-off scripts will probably require changes.  In practical terms thsi really means your old scripts will need to be pinned to v0.16.1 and new scripts can use v0.17 since there is little reason to upgrade old single-use code.  This can be done by creating two virtual (or conda) environments with each version of prysm, and just activating the one containing prysm v0.16 if you need to look at your old code again (identifying it by looking at the last modified or created date).\n",
